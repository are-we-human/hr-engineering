Ensure compensation remains consistently market-top, as this is merely the baseline expectation. Motivating & Upskilling: Focus on high-level, strategic challenges that demand their unique problem-solving abilities. Empower them to define strategic direction rather than just execute. What causes them to leave: Be mindful that even in this optimal state, an unparalleled external opportunity or a sense of plateauing could cause them to seek new challenges.",

During hiring, diligence is key to verifying a sustained team-oriented contribution and openness to feedback, not just impressive presentation.

Instead, assign tasks that directly challenge their perceived expertise or cannot be navigated purely by charm. This can involve objective peer review of their work. Motivating & Upskilling: Link their perceived reputation directly to new skill mastery that requires genuine adaptation. Encourage them to take on projects that require collaborative effort and accepting constructive criticism.

They often use their strong presentation skills to externalize blame.
